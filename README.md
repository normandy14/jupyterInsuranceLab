# Insurance Charges Notebook

## Project Objective
The purpose of this project to practice data analytics skills. Programming takes most of my time, but after building several web applications with Python, the learning time to learn Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Scikit-learn was relatively short.

This Jupyter lab notebook focuses on EDA, exploratory data analysis, as well as linear regression.

## Kaggle Dataset
The data is obtained from a Kaggle dataset, [Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)

### Dataset Breakdown

#### Columns
- age: age of primary beneficiary
- sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male
- bmi: Body mass index, using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
- children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
- smoker: Smoking
- region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
- charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

#### Methods Used
